<H3>Architecture</H3>

<p>Metis 2.1 [<a href="#References">Hur03</A>] is a proof tactic used
in the
<a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/">HOL4</a> interactive theorem
prover. It works by converting a higher order logic goal to a set of
clauses in first order logic, with the property that a refutation of
the clause set can be translated to a higher order logic proof of the
original goal.</p>

<p>Experiments with various first order calculi
[<a href="#References">Hur03</a>] have shown a <em>given clause
algorithm</em> and ordered resolution to best suit this application,
and that is what Metis 2.1 implements. Since equality often appears in
interactive theorem prover goals, Metis 2.1 also implements the
ordered paramodulation calculus.</p>

<H3>Implementation</H3>

<p>Metis 2.1 is written in Standard ML, for ease of integration with
HOL4. It uses indexes for resolution, paramodulation, (forward)
subsumption and demodulation. It keeps the <em>Active</em> clause set
reduced with respect to all the unit equalities so far derived.</p>

<p>In addition to standard size and distance measures, Metis 2.1 uses
finite models to weight clauses in the <em>Passive</em> set. When
integrated with higher order logic, a finite model is manually
constructed to interpret standard functions and relations in such a
way as to make many standard axioms true and negated goals false.
Non-standard functions and relations are interpreted randomly, but
with a bias towards making negated goals false. Since it is part of
the CASC competition rules that standard functions and relations are
obfuscated, Metis 2.1 will back off to the biased random
interpretation of all functions and relations (except equality), using a
finite model with 4 elements.</p>

<p>Metis 2.1 reads problems in TPTP format and outputs detailed proofs
in TSTP format, where each proof step is one of 6 simple inference
rules. Metis 2.1 implements a complete calculus, so when the set of
clauses is saturated it can soundly declare the input problem to be
unprovable (and outputs the saturation set).</p>

<p>Metis 2.1 is free software, released under the GPL. It can be
downloaded from

<H3>Strategies</H3>

<p>Metis 2.1 uses a fixed strategy for every input problem. Negative
literals are always chosen in favour of positive literals, and terms
are ordered using the Knuth-Bendix ordering with uniform symbol weight
and precedence favouring reduced arity.</p>

<H3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

<p>The major change between Metis 2.0, which was entered into CASC 21,
and Metis 2.1 is the TSTP proof format. There were only minor changes
to the core proof engine, so Metis 2.1 is expected to perform at
approximately the same level and end up in the lower half of the
table.</p>
