<h1>Frequently Asked Questions About Metis</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Where can I download Metis?</h4>

<p>The most recent version of Metis can be downloaded from

<a href="http://www.gilith.com/software/metis/"><tt>http://www.gilith.com/software/metis/</tt></a>.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Where is the Metis documentation?</h4>

<p>The

<a href="http://www.gilith.com/research/metis/">Metis home page</a>

contains a collection of links to resources.</p>

<p>The command

<tt>metis --help</tt>

is used to display tool help.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no documentation for the source code of
Metis, but one design goal of the code was to make it readable, and
I'd be happy to answer questions about it emailed to

<a href="mailto:metis-users@gilith.com">metis-users@gilith.com</a></p>

<hr />

<h4>Is there a Metis mailing list?</h4>

<p>There is an email list for Metis users: you can subscribe and view
the archives at

<a href="http://www.gilith.com/mailman/listinfo/metis-users"><tt>http://www.gilith.com/mailman/listinfo/metis-users</tt></a>.</p>

<hr />

<h4>What version of ML should I use to compile Metis?</h4>

<p>I strongly recommend using MLton (or Poly/ML) over Moscow ML to run
opentheory, for reasons of speed (MLton is about 10 times faster than
Moscow ML).</p>

<hr />

<h4>Why are there no paramodulation steps in Metis proofs?</h4>

<p>Metis is doing a paramodulation step internally, but this is broken
down in the CNF refutation into one of six simple inference rules,
which are described in

<a href="logical-kernel.txt"><tt>doc/logical-kernel.txt</tt></a>

and can be found in the Thm module of the source code.</p>

<p>The approach of breaking proofs down into tiny inference rules is
done to make it easier to replay the proofs when Metis is being used
as a tactic in a higher order logic theorem prover, but it makes the
proofs less readable.</p>
