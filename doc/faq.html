<h1>Frequently Asked Questions About Metis</h1>

<hr />

<h4>Where can I download Metis?</h4>

<p>The most recent version of Metis can be downloaded from

<a href="http://www.gilith.com/software/metis/"><tt>http://www.gilith.com/software/metis/</tt></a>.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Where is the Metis documentation?</h4>

<p>The

<a href="http://www.gilith.com/metis">Metis home page</a>

contains a collection of links to resources.</p>

<p>The command

<tt>metis --help</tt>

is used to display tool help.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Is there a Metis mailing list?</h4>

<p>Not any more. Between 2010 and 2017 there was a mailing list for
Metis users; you can view the archives at

<a href="http://www.gilith.com/metis/mailing-list"><tt>http://www.gilith.com/metis/mailing-list</tt></a>.</p>

<hr />

<h4>What version of ML should I use to compile Metis?</h4>

<p>I strongly recommend using MLton (or Poly/ML) over Moscow ML to run
Metis, for reasons of speed (MLton is about 10 times faster than
Moscow ML).</p>

<hr />

<h4>Why are there no paramodulation steps in Metis proofs?</h4>

<p>Metis is doing a paramodulation step internally, but this is broken
down in the CNF refutation into one of six simple inference rules,
which are described in

<a href="logical-kernel.txt"><tt>doc/logical-kernel.txt</tt></a>

and can be found in the Thm module of the source code.</p>

<p>The approach of breaking proofs down into tiny inference rules is
done to make it easier to replay the proofs when Metis is being used
as a tactic in a higher order logic theorem prover, but it makes the
proofs less readable.</p>
