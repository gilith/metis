<H3>Architecture</H3>

<p>Metis 2.2 [Hur03] is a proof tactic used in the
<a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/">HOL4</a> interactive theorem
prover. It works by converting a higher order logic goal to a set of
clauses in first order logic, with the property that a refutation of
the clause set can be translated to a higher order logic proof of the
original goal.</p>

<p>Experiments with various first order calculi [Hur03] have shown
a <em>given clause algorithm</em> and ordered resolution to best suit
this application, and that is what Metis 2.2 implements. Since
equality often appears in interactive theorem prover goals, Metis 2.2
also implements the ordered paramodulation calculus.</p>

<H3>Strategies</H3>

<p>Metis 2.2 uses a fixed strategy for every input problem. Negative
literals are always chosen over positive literals, and terms are
ordered using the Knuth-Bendix ordering with uniform symbol weight and
precedence favouring reduced arity.</p>

<H3>Implementation</H3>

<p>Metis 2.2 is written in Standard ML, for ease of integration with
HOL4. It uses indexes for resolution, paramodulation, (forward)
subsumption and demodulation. It keeps the <em>Active</em> clause set
reduced with respect to all the unit equalities so far derived.</p>

<p>In addition to standard age and size measures, Metis 2.2 uses
finite models to weight clauses in the <em>Passive</em> set. When
integrated with higher order logic, a finite model is manually
constructed to interpret standard functions and relations in such a
way as to make many standard axioms true and negated goals false.
Non-standard functions and relations are interpreted randomly, but
with a bias towards making negated goals false. Since it is part of
the CASC competition rules that standard functions and relations are
obfuscated, Metis 2.2 will back off to the biased random
interpretation of all functions and relations (except equality), using
a finite model with 4 elements.</p>

<p>Metis 2.2 reads problems in TPTP format and outputs detailed proofs
in TSTP format, where each refutation step is one of 6 simple
inference rules. Metis 2.2 implements a complete calculus, so when the
set of clauses is saturated it can soundly declare the input problem
to be unprovable (and outputs the saturation set).</p>

<p>Metis 2.2 is free software, released under the GPL. It can be
downloaded from

<H3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

<p>The major change between Metis 2.1, which was entered into CASC J4,
and Metis 2.2 is the representation of normalization steps in TSTP
proof format. There were only minor changes to the core proof engine,
so Metis 2.2 is expected to perform at approximately the same level
and end up in the lower half of the table.</p>
