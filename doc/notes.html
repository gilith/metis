<h3>What's in a Name?</h3>

<p>Metis (the theorem prover) is pronounced "MET iss".

<ul>
<li>
In Greek mythology, <a
href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metis_(Titan)">Metis</a> was a
Titaness who was the first wife of Zeus and the mother of Athena. She
was the goddess of wisdom and deep thought.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metis_(moon)">Metis</a> is the
innermost moon of Jupiter, lying within the planetary ring. The image
of Metis at the bottom of this web page was taken by the Galileo
probe.
</li>

<li>
The
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metis_(people)">M&eacute;tis</a>
people of Canada are mixed-blood offspring of European fur traders and
Cree, Ojibway or Saulteaux women.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Metis began life in August 2001 as an intended replacement for the
<tt>MESON_TAC</tt> proof tactic in HOL4. The first release of Metis in
HOL (called <tt>METIS_TAC</tt>) occurred in July 2002 featuring a
robust model elimination calculus. By November 2002 Metis also
implemented the ordered paramodulation calculus, and shortly after
gained some users in the form of HOL developers wishing to speed up
their theory development.</p>

<p>September 2002 marked the appearance of the Metis standalone
program, compiled to native code using the MLton compiler. This
version of Metis is used for profiling the code and investigating
performance on harder problems from the TPTP archive. This line of
research led to an implementation of inherited term ordering
constraints using the Omega procedure to check consistency.</p>

<p>As of August 2003, the latest release of Metis comprises around
13,000 non-comment lines of SML code.</p>

<h3>Author</h3>

<p>Metis is developed by <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jeh1004">Joe Hurd</a> to support
his <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jeh1004/research/metis">research</a>
in the CARD Group, <a href="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/">Computing
Laboratory</a>, <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">Oxford University</a>,
UK.</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Metis 1.x used an SML version of the <a
href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/omega/">Omega procedure</a>,
implemented by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mn200/">Michael
Norrish</a> and ported to MLton by <a
href="http://www.itu.dk/people/kfl/">Ken Friis Larsen</a>.</li>

<li>Some early Metis code and example problems were based on the <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jrh/atp/index.html">theorem
proving examples</a> of <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jrh/">John Harrison</a>.</li>

<li>Metis has been much improved by feedback from <a
href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/">HOL4</a> users, especially <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mn200/">Michael Norrish</a>, <a
href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~slind/">Konrad Slind</a> and <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mjcg/">Mike Gordon</a>.</li>

<li>The <a href="http://www.mlton.org/">MLton</a> team, particularly
<a href="http://www.sweeks.com/">Stephen Weeks</a>, helped Metis by
making many improvements to the MLton profiling system.</li>
