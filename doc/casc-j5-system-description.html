<H3>Architecture</H3>

<p>Metis 2.2 [Hur03] is a proof tactic used in the

<a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/">HOL4</a>

interactive theorem prover. It works by converting a higher order
logic goal to a set of clauses in first order logic, with the property
that a refutation of the clause set can be translated to a higher
order logic proof of the original goal.</p>

<p>Experiments with various first order calculi [Hur03] have shown
a <em>given clause algorithm</em> and ordered resolution to best suit
this application, and that is what Metis 2.2 implements. Since
equality often appears in interactive theorem prover goals, Metis 2.2
also implements the ordered paramodulation calculus.</p>

<H3>Strategies</H3>

<p>Metis 2.2 uses a fixed strategy for every input problem. Negative
literals are always chosen over positive literals, and terms are
ordered using the Knuth-Bendix ordering with uniform symbol weight and
precedence favouring reduced arity.</p>

<H3>Implementation</H3>

<p>Metis 2.2 is written in Standard ML, for ease of integration with
HOL4. It uses indexes for resolution, paramodulation, (forward)
subsumption and demodulation. It keeps the <em>Active</em> clause set
reduced with respect to all the unit equalities so far derived.</p>

<p>In addition to standard age and size measures, Metis 2.2 uses
finite models to weight clauses in the <em>Passive</em> set. When
integrated with higher order logic, an interpretation of known
functions and relations is manually constructed to make many of their
standard properties valid in the finite model. For example, the domain
of the model is the set <em>{0,...,7}</em>, and the higher order logic
arithmetic functions are interpreted in the model modulo <em>8</em>.
Unknown functions and relations are interpreted randomly, but with a
bias towards making supporting theorems valid in the model. The finite
model strategy carries over to TPTP problems, by manually interpreting
a collection of functions and relations that appear in TPTP axiom
files in such a way as to make the axioms valid in the model.</p>

<p>Metis 2.2 reads problems in TPTP format and outputs detailed proofs
in TSTP format, where each refutation step is one of 6 simple
inference rules. Metis 2.2 implements a complete calculus, so when the
set of clauses is saturated it can soundly declare the input problem
to be unprovable (and outputs the saturation set).</p>

<p>Metis 2.2 is free software, released under the GPL. It can be

<H3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

<p>There have been only minor changes to Metis 2.2 since CASC 22, so
it is expected to perform at approximately the same level in CASC J5
and end up in the lower half of the table. However, it is possible
that Metis 2.2 might get a boost from its finite model clause
weighting, since this year the CASC competition rules have changed so
that function and relation names are no longer obfuscated.</p>
