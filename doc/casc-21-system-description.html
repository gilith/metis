<H3>Architecture</H3>

<p>Metis 2.0 [<a href="#References">Hur03</A>] is a proof tactic used
in the
<a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/">HOL4</a> interactive theorem
prover. It works by converting a higher order logic goal to a set of
clauses in first order logic, with the property that a refutation of
the clause set can be translated to a higher order logic proof of the
original goal.</p>

<p>Experiments with various first order calculi
[<a href="#References">Hur03</a>] have shown a <em>given clause
algorithm</em> and ordered resolution to best suit this application,
and that is what Metis 2.0 implements. Since equality often appears in
higher order logic goals, Metis 2.0 also implements the ordered
paramodulation calculus.</p>

<H3>Implementation</H3>

<p>Metis 2.0 is written in Standard ML, for ease of integration with
HOL4. It uses indexes for resolution, paramodulation, (forward)
subsumption and demodulation. It keeps the <em>Active</em> clause set
reduced with respect to all the unit equalities so far derived.</p>

<p>In addition to standard size and distance measures, Metis 2.0 uses
finite models to weight clauses in the <em>Waiting</em> set. When
integrated with higher order logic, a finite model is manually
constructed to interpret standard functions and relations in such a
way as to make many standard axioms true and negated goals false.
Non-standard functions and relations are interpreted randomly. Since
it is part of the CASC competition rules that standard functions and
relations are obfuscated, Metis 2.0 will back-off to interpreting all
functions and relations randomly (except equality).</p>

<p>Metis 2.0 is free software, released under the GPL. It can be
downloaded from

<H3>Strategies</H3>

<p>Metis 2.0 uses a fixed strategy for every input problem. Negative
literals are always chosen in favour of positive literals, and terms
are ordered using the Knuth-Bendix ordering with uniform symbol weight
and precedence favouring reduced arity.</p>

<H3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

<p>Running previous versions of Metis on previous MIX problem sets has
scored in the bottom half of the table, so that is the expected
performance. Metis 2.0 always keeps proofs, so the performance will be
no different in the proof classes.</p>

<p>Testing on previous UEQ problem sets has shown Metis to be weak on
equality problems, so I expect Metis 2.0 to perform relatively worse
on the equality divisions, particularly UEQ.</p>
